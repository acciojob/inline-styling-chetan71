		<p>Who says you have to settle for beautiful flowers only during the summer months? With a little planning, you can enjoy flowers that bloom from spring to summer to fall. And even in winter, many different types of cold-hardy winter bloomers can add color and life to your garden</p>

		<p>The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species, they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (−13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.</p>
